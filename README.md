Plugin for Tiny Tiny RSS that allows to fetch data from Instagram user sites.

##Subscribing 
The plugin needs an existing feed in Tiny Tiny RSS. If you have none, you can subscribe to a dummy feed
with the content

`````
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rss version="2.0"><channel><item/></channel></rss>
````

that you have put into a file on your host. To subscribe to it in Tiny Tiny RSS, use the URL
*http://localhost/yourpath/andfile*.
This should put a feed with feed title *[Unknown]* into the feed list.
You can change its URL to the URL of the Instagram user you want to follow then.
